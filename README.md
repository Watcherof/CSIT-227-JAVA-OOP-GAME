# CSIT-227-JAVA-OOP-GAME
Echoes of War: The Guardian's Path
TARGET OUT COME BY FRIDAY
IMPLEMENT THE HEALING SYSTEM AND THE SHIELD SYSTEM
BUG IN TRYING TO SWITCH FROM MAGE CLASS TO VERDANT WARDEN
(EXAMPLE: CURRENT CHAR:AQUAMANCER CHOICE = 4)

Average round /Minimum rounds for a player to be defeated is 13 without shields and heals 

TODO make sure that the game automatically ends if there is no possible roll
make sure that if the character is dead then the rolls wont be counted in checking wheter or not if the
characters have enough resouces 
example 
stamina 2 - mana 6; spirit - 2
but the user of spirit is dead so it must not count it 
but in the code it is counted so fix the bug
